  turingFact: In 1950 Alan uring suggested a test that would measure the intellect
    of a computer. In the test, the human participant has to communicate with a computer
    and another person using written language. All participants have to remain in
    isolated rooms so the person who plays the role of a judge doesn't know which
    responses come from the human and the computer. If based on the given answers
    the judge can't accurately guess whether the answers were given by a computer
    or a human, the computer then passes the test. The Turing test is an important
    part of the artificial intelligence philosophy but it is criticized for being
    impractical and inaccurate - it can reveal whether the computer can imitate a
    human being and not show its actual intellect.
